    title: "Simply the Best Eating Plan and Diet â€” For Me.",
    tags: "Food",

    body: "Covid played havoc with my health. I gained a lot of weight and I lost my fitness. I developed some issues, all due, I suppose to increasing inertia and too much bad food. It was difficult to switch to a better way of eating in the circumstances, but now that Iâ€™m settled, Iâ€™m back to normal. So I wanted to share my health and eating way of life with you.    Regardless of what anyone tells you, the only way to lose weight is a reduction in calories, and the only time you lose weight is when your stomach is empty, and the only way that weight leaves your body is through sweat and urine.   Food allery is when your body sees a particular food as a poison whereas food intolerance is when your body does not have an enzyme to break down that particular food. For example, if your body does not have lactase, it will be unable to break down lactose, and if it doesnâ€™t have the enzyme to break down gluten, you will eventually develop celiac disease. The problem with food intolerances is that you can have them for years without knowing that your body is not breaking down these foods, and over a period of time, you will get ill, gain weight, and develop all sorts of discomforts.",

    title: "Kheerganga â€” The Trek to the eternal mystical dip ðŸ’“",
    tags: "Travel",

    body: "The amazing thing about the Trek of Kheerganga is itâ€™s short (2-day affair), and relatively easy & at the end of the trek awaits the warm dip in the hot springs making it 100% worthwhile.I had heard a lot about Kasol and therefore it attracted me for its varied culture, cuisine, and abundant natural beauty. Kasol is famous among backpackers and people who love to stay high (Charas or Marijuana).The place offers a fabulous blend of Israeli culture, quaint landscapes, and unspoiled nature. Though Kasol is not a great destination for a family holiday, however, you canâ€™t deny the gratification you get in doing something out of the ordinary.To reach Kheerganga there are two trails from Barshaini. One is via the village Kalga and the second is through Shiva Temple. The route via village Kalga is shorter but steep, slippery & dangerous. Still, I took the Kalga route as I wanted to enjoy nature and explore the flora. Luckily on the day of the trek weather was clear with no rains.The trail started with semi-pukka ( Half Constructed) trails as there is construction going on for the Hydel reservoir for the power project. The trail had full vegetation alongside. One can easily make out that the route is well used by the locals as the trail was broad and seasoned mud. The gradient was level and the ascent was not at all steep. We were just traversing the circumference of a mountain towards the left. After walking for a while the trek opens into rich green fields.It is said that Lord Shiva meditated in this Parvati valley for about 3,000 odd years. He is believed to have taken the form of a naga sadhu or a naked ash-smeared sanyasi. Seasons came and went and one day he opened his eyes and looked at this untouched, beautiful landscape and named it Parvati after his consort.There is an old Shiva temple in Kheerganga. It is said that Kartik, the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati lived here in Kheerganga. Kartik was so mesmerised by the place and the mountains that he meditated here for thousands of years. You can find many stories of legends from the local villagers and they are quite excited to tell the stories. It is a ritual to pay homage to the temple every morning before you enter the pool to take bath.Itâ€™s humbling to take time to think that mountains have been here for millions of years before us and will be here long after we have gone. Youâ€™ll easily find yourself surrounded by absolute silence and miles of untouched natural beauty, further than your eyes can see.",
